# AngularLearning
This repository contains my first app project create when I started Angular learning journey.

## ðŸ¤– Introduction
To learn Angular, what better way to start than with a small project? ðŸ˜Š
The project is about creating a web application for managing and displaying housing listings.

## ðŸ”‹Application Features
- Displaying housing listings
- Allowing users to browse, search, and view details about various homes
- Load data from a mock API
  
## Learning outcome
By building the Home Housing Application, I learn how to: 
- structure an Angular project
- create and use components effectively
- implement routing and navigation
- fetch and manage data using services
- Style and presente data dynamically
- Handle user input with Angular forms

## Angular features used:
- Components, Templates, and Directives
- Dependency Injection and Services
- Routing for navigation
- Forms for user input

- Installations:
node js

- Install Angular/cli : `npm install -g @angular/cli`

- Create an app : `ng new app-name` or `ng new app-name --inline-style --inline-template` (add optionals configurations)

- Run the application : `ng serve`

- create a sandalone server (Mock API, local data for backend simulation)
 `npm install -g json-server`

- Run the sandalone sever
 `json-server --watch db.json`
